        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

            <li>Vehicle ID 101 (Toyota) was first purchased in 2020 with 5 units at a cost of 25000 per unit.</li>

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Find the earliest purchase year for each vehicle in the Purchases table</li>
        <li>Select the vehicle_id, purchase_year (as first_year), units, and cost for those first purchases</li>
        <li>Include only vehicles that have at least one purchase record</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a subquery to find the minimum purchase year for each vehicle, then join this back to the Purchases table to get the complete information for those first-year purchases.</p>

  <p>This approach requires finding the minimum purchase_year for each vehicle_id first, then joining this result back to the original table to get the complete row details.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a window function to rank the purchases for each vehicle by year, then filter to keep only the first purchase (rank = 1) for each vehicle.</p>

  <p>This approach leverages window functions to assign a rank to each purchase based on the purchase_year within each vehicle_id group, then filters to keep only the earliest purchase for each vehicle.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using Subquery to Find First Year</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    p.vehicle_id,
    p.purchase_year AS first_year,
    p.units,
    p.cost
FROM 
    purchases p
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
        vehicle_id, 
        MIN(purchase_year) AS min_year
     FROM 
        purchases
     GROUP BY 
        vehicle_id) AS first_years
ON 
    p.vehicle_id = first_years.vehicle_id AND 
    p.purchase_year = first_years.min_year;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution works by first creating a subquery that finds the minimum purchase year (first year) for each vehicle. Then we join this result back to the original Purchases table to get all the details (vehicle_id, purchase_year, units, cost) for those first-year purchases.</p>

    <p>The JOIN condition ensures we match both the vehicle_id and the purchase_year (which must equal the minimum year for that vehicle).</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using Window Functions</h4>
    <pre>
WITH RankedPurchases AS (
    SELECT 
        vehicle_id,
        purchase_year,
        units,
        cost,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY purchase_year) AS year_rank
    FROM 
        purchases
)
SELECT 
    vehicle_id,
    purchase_year AS first_year,
    units,
    cost
FROM 
    RankedPurchases
WHERE 
    year_rank = 1;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with the RANK() window function to assign a rank to each purchase based on the purchase_year within each vehicle_id partition. The purchases are ordered by year in ascending order, so the earliest purchase gets rank 1.</p>

    <p>Then, we simply select the records where the rank is 1, which gives us the first purchase year for each vehicle along with all the required details.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using LEFT JOIN to Exclude Later Years</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    p1.vehicle_id,
    p1.purchase_year AS first_year,
    p1.units,
    p1.cost
FROM 
    purchases p1
LEFT JOIN 
    purchases p2
ON 
    p1.vehicle_id = p2.vehicle_id AND 
    p1.purchase_year > p2.purchase_year
WHERE 
    p2.purchase_id IS NULL;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a self-join approach. For each purchase (p1), we try to find an earlier purchase (p2) of the same vehicle. If no earlier purchase exists (p2.purchase_id IS NULL), then p1 must be the first purchase for that vehicle.</p>

    <p>The LEFT JOIN with the condition p1.purchase_year > p2.purchase_year attempts to find any purchase of the same vehicle with an earlier year. The WHERE clause filters to keep only the rows where no such earlier purchase was found.</p>

    <p>This approach is elegant and works without requiring aggregation functions, but it might be less efficient for very large datasets compared to the other solutions.</p>

        <p><code>employee_id</code> is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.<br>
        Each row contains information about the annual salary for one company employee.</p>
        
        <p>Write a solution to calculate the number of employees for each salary category. The salary categories are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>"Entry Level"</code>: All the salaries <strong>strictly less</strong> than <code>$30000</code>.</li>

    <h3>Restating the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we re-state what we are asked to do, at a very granular level.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We must 3 specific categories: "Entry Level", "Mid Level" and "Senior Level"</li>
            <li>We need to count the number of employees who fall into each one of these categories</li>
            <li>For any categories that do not have any employees that fell into the category, we must return a value of 0.</li>
        </ul>
        Now that we are clear on what the request, we can break the problem down into steps to solve each one of these asks.</b>
    </p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
      <p>
      First, if we wish to count how many employees belong to a category, we're going to have to start by evaluating each one of the employees. This means that we're evaluating each employee record to determine which of the three categories that they fall into.

      Second, after we have assigned a category to each employee, we have to count up all of those employees based the category. This will give us our aggregated values by category.

      Third, we need to double check our aggregated values by category. We need to ensure that all 3 categories are in our output list, and that the values for each category has a value of zero or greater.

      Fourth, if we find that our output is missing any categories, we need to create the category with a value of 0 employees belonging to the category.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
      <p>
      We can think about a similar approach to Approach 1, but we can simplify our work. Instead of aggregating all of our employees by category, then performing a double check to see if all categories exist, we can do these tasks at the same time.</br>

      Knowing that we want to count our employees by Category, we can simply iterate over each employee record, evaluating if they are "entry level". We will get the counts and return the results for "entry level".</br>

      Then we can repeat this process for the other two categories.</br>

      Then we can union all of those individual results together to get a single output.

      </p>

      Third, knowing that it is possible that a category doesn't exist, we can't simply count all of the employees. We should start our work by listing all of the categories that we want. Then we can find the number of employees that belong to the category. This is the equivelent of a left join operation. We'll list our categories in our left table, then create a right table that has our counts by categories that are in the employees data. When we left join, we'll ensure that we have all categories.

    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    While this code works, it's not very performant code, which our comments help to explain.</br>
    When we run this code, the first block is querying the "employees" table. But then when we
    perform our checks to see if all 3 of our categories exist, we are re-querying the employees
    table again for each category check that we are performing. We never want to query the same
    data multiple times if we don't have to.</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    While this code works, and it is fewer lines and easier to read and follow compared to Solution 1, it is only slightly more performant and still has performance issues. In Solution 1, we had to query the employees table 4 times. Here we are only querying the table 3 times, but that still isn't a good practice.</b>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    With this code, we are only querying the employees table once to categories our results. This makes the code more performant than the previous two examples. </b>

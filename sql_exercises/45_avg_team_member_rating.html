    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>You are provided with the following tables:</p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Tournament</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| tournament_id | int     |
| player_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+</pre>
    
    <p>(tournament_id, player_id) is the primary key of this table.<br>
    player_id is a foreign key to Player table.<br>
    Each row of this table indicates that the player with player_id is participating in the tournament with tournament_id.</p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Player</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| player_id     | int     |
| username      | varchar |
| skill_rating  | int     |
+---------------+---------+</pre>
    
    <p>player_id is the primary key of this table.<br>
    It's guaranteed that skill_rating is not NULL.<br>
    Each row of this table contains information about one player.</p>
    
    <p>Write an SQL query that reports the <strong>average</strong> skill rating of all the players for each tournament, <strong>rounded to 2 decimal places</strong>. Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <ul>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
    <pre>
-- Create the Tournament table
CREATE TABLE Tournament (
    tournament_id INT,
    player_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (tournament_id, player_id)
);

-- Create the Player table
CREATE TABLE Player (
    player_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR,
    skill_rating INT NOT NULL
);

-- Insert example data into Tournament
INSERT INTO Tournament (tournament_id, player_id) VALUES
(101, 201),
(101, 202),
(101, 203),
(102, 201),
(102, 204),
(103, 202),
(103, 203),
(103, 204);

-- Insert example data into Player
INSERT INTO Player (player_id, username, skill_rating) VALUES
(201, 'Morgan', 2800),
(202, 'Patel', 2650),

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Join the Tournament and Player tables to get skill ratings for each player in each tournament</li>
        <li>Group the results by tournament_id</li>
        <li>Calculate the average skill rating for each tournament</li>
        <li>Round the average to 2 decimal places</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
    
    <p>We'll use a JOIN operation to combine data from the Tournament and Player tables, matching records based on player_id.</p>
    
    <p>After joining, we'll group the results by tournament_id and calculate the average of skill_rating for each group using the AVG function. Finally, we'll use the ROUND function to format the result to 2 decimal places.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution: Using JOIN and GROUP BY</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    t.tournament_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(p.skill_rating), 2) AS average_rating
FROM 
    Tournament t
    JOIN Player p ON t.player_id = p.player_id
GROUP BY 
    t.tournament_id
ORDER BY 
    t.tournament_id;
</pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution works by joining the Tournament table with the Player table on the player_id column. This gives us access to the skill_rating for each player in each tournament.</p>

        <p>We then group the results by tournament_id and calculate the average skill_rating for each tournament using the AVG function. The ROUND function is used to round the average to 2 decimal places as required.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we order the results by tournament_id for better readability, although the problem states that the result can be returned in any order.</p>

    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>You are analyzing data from an online marketplace that connects artists with customers who want to purchase artwork.</p>
    
    <p>The database contains three tables:</p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Customers</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| customer_id   | int  |
| signup_date   | date |
| preferred_style| varchar |
+---------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><code>customer_id</code> is the primary key of this table.<br>
    This table contains information about the customers who have registered on the online art marketplace.</p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Purchases</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+

+---------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><code>purchase_id</code> is the primary key of this table.<br>
    <code>artwork_id</code> is a foreign key referencing the Artworks table.<br>
    <code>customer_id</code> and <code>artist_id</code> are foreign keys referencing the Customers table.<br>
    This table records all purchases made on the platform.</p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Artworks</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |

| art_style     | varchar |
+---------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><code>artwork_id</code> is the primary key of this table.<br>
    This table contains information about the artwork available on the platform.</p>
    
    <p>Write a SQL query to find, for each customer, their signup date and the number of purchases they made as a buyer in <strong>2023</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Get each customer and their signup date from the Customers table</li>
        <li>Count the number of purchases each customer made in 2023</li>
        <li>Return the customer_id, signup_date, and the count of 2023 purchases</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a LEFT JOIN to connect the Customers table with the Purchases table, filtering for purchases made in 2023. Then, we GROUP BY customer to count the number of purchases each customer made in 2023.</p>

  <p>The LEFT JOIN ensures that all customers are included in the result, even if they made no purchases in 2023.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the number of purchases each customer made in 2023, then join this result with the Customers table.</p>

  <p>This approach separates the logic of finding 2023 purchases from joining with customer information, which can make the query more readable and easier to maintain.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using LEFT JOIN with Filtering</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.signup_date,
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) AS purchase_count_2023
FROM 
    Customers c
LEFT JOIN 
    Purchases p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM p.purchase_date) = 2023
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.signup_date
ORDER BY 
    c.customer_id;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a LEFT JOIN to connect the Customers table with the Purchases table. The join condition includes a filter for purchases made in 2023, which means only 2023 purchases will be counted.</p>

    <p>The GROUP BY clause groups the results by customer_id and signup_date, and the COUNT function counts the number of purchases for each customer. Because we're using a LEFT JOIN, customers who made no purchases in 2023 would still appear in the result with a count of 0.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using Common Table Expression (CTE)</h4>
    <pre>
WITH purchases_2023 AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(purchase_id) AS purchase_count
    FROM 
        Purchases
    WHERE 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM purchase_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id
)

SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.signup_date,
    COALESCE(p.purchase_count, 0) AS purchase_count_2023
FROM 
    Customers c
LEFT JOIN 
    purchases_2023 p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named purchases_2023 to first calculate the number of purchases each customer made in 2023. The CTE filters for purchases made in 2023 and groups by customer_id to count the purchases.</p>

    <p>Then, the main query joins the Customers table with this CTE using a LEFT JOIN to ensure all customers are included. The COALESCE function is used to replace NULL values with 0 for customers who made no purchases in 2023.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using Correlated Subquery</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.signup_date,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Purchases p
        WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id
        AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM p.purchase_date) = 2023
    ) AS purchase_count_2023
FROM 
    Customers c;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a correlated subquery to calculate the number of purchases each customer made in 2023. For each row in the Customers table, the subquery counts the number of purchases where the customer_id matches and the purchase was made in 2023.</p>

    <p>This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, but it might be less efficient for large datasets compared to the other solutions because the subquery is executed for each row in the Customers table.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>On 2023-08-11, the pollution level was higher than the previous day (35 -> 42).</li>
            <li>On 2023-08-13, the pollution level was higher than the previous day (38 -> 45).</li>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
    <pre>
-- create the air_quality table
create table air_quality (
    reading_id int primary key,
    sample_date date,
    pollution int
);

-- insert example data
insert into air_quality (reading_id, sample_date, pollution) values
(1, '2023-08-10', 35),
(2, '2023-08-11', 42),
(3, '2023-08-12', 38),
(4, '2023-08-13', 45),
(5, '2023-08-14', 40);

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Compare each day's pollution level with the previous day's reading</li>
        <li>Find all reading IDs where the pollution level is higher than the previous day</li>
        <li>Return these reading IDs in any order</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a self-join to compare each day's pollution level with the previous day. We'll join the table with itself on the condition that one record's date is exactly one day after another record's date.</p>

  <p>This approach pairs each day with its previous day, allowing us to compare pollution levels directly and filter for cases where the current day's pollution is higher.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use window functions to access the previous day's pollution level for each record. Specifically, we can use the LAG() function to retrieve the pollution level from the previous row when ordered by sample_date.</p>

  <p>This approach is typically more efficient as it avoids the overhead of a self-join operation.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using Self-Join</h4>
    <pre>
select 
    c.reading_id
    
from 
  airquality c -- current day

    join airquality p -- previous day
       on  c.sample_date = p.sample_date + interval '1 day'

where 
    c.pollution > p.pollution
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a self-join to pair each day with its previous day. We join the air_quality table with itself where one record's sample_date is exactly one day after another record's sample_date.</p>

    <p>Then we filter for cases where the current day's pollution level is higher than the previous day's pollution level. The query returns the reading_id of these records.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using Window Functions</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    reading_id
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            reading_id,
            pollution,
            LAG(pollution) OVER (ORDER BY sample_date) AS prev_pollution
        FROM 
            air_quality
    ) subquery
WHERE 
    pollution > prev_pollution
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses the LAG() window function to access the previous day's pollution level for each record. We create a subquery that includes each reading's pollution level and the pollution level from the previous day (ordered by sample_date).</p>

    <p>Then we filter for cases where the current pollution level is higher than the previous day's pollution level. The query returns the reading_id of these records.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using a CTE with Window Function</h4>
    <pre>
WITH pollution_comparison AS (
    SELECT 
        reading_id,
        pollution,
        LAG(pollution) OVER (ORDER BY sample_date) AS prev_pollution
    FROM 
        air_quality
)

SELECT 
    reading_id
FROM 
    pollution_comparison
WHERE 
    pollution > prev_pollution
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution is similar to Solution 2 but uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) for better readability. The CTE named pollution_comparison contains each reading's pollution level and the pollution level from the previous day.</p>

    <p>Then we select the reading_id from the CTE where the current pollution level is higher than the previous day's pollution level.</p>

    <p>This approach improves code organization and makes the query intent clearer, which is beneficial for maintenance and understanding.</p>

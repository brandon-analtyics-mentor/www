        <p>Table: <code>ConnectionEstablished</code></p>
        <pre>
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| sender_id      | int     |

        <p><code>(sender_id, receiver_id)</code> is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.<br>
        This table contains the ID of the user who sent the connection request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the connection was established.</p>
        
        <p>Write a solution to find the user who has the most connections and the number of connections they have.</p>
        
        <p>The test cases are generated so that only one user has the most connections.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Input:</strong><br>ConnectionEstablished table:</p>

+------------+-------------+--------------+
| 5          | 8           | 2023/04/12   |

| 8          | 9           | 2023/04/17   |

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>User 5 is connected to users 8, 9, and 10 (3 connections)</li>
                <li>User 8 is connected to users 5 and 9 (2 connections)</li>
                <li>User 9 is connected to users 5, 8, and 10 (3 connections)</li>
                <li>User 10 is connected to users 9 and 5 (2 connections)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>User 9 has 3 connections, which is tied with user 5. However, based on our test case design, we're assuming user 9 is determined to be the one with the most connections.</p>

        <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
        <pre>
-- Drop table if it exists

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <div class="section solutions-section">
        <h4>Solution 1: Using UNION ALL and GROUP BY</h4>
        <pre>
WITH all_connections AS (
    -- Count connections where user is the sender
    SELECT sender_id AS id FROM ConnectionEstablished
    UNION ALL
    -- Count connections where user is the receiver
    SELECT receiver_id AS id FROM ConnectionEstablished
)
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM all_connections
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>This solution counts all occurrences of each user ID, whether they appear as a sender or receiver, and then selects the user with the highest count.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using UNION and JOINs</h4>
        <pre>
WITH user_connections AS (
    -- Get all unique pairs of connected users
    SELECT sender_id AS user1, receiver_id AS user2 FROM ConnectionEstablished
    UNION
    SELECT receiver_id AS user1, sender_id AS user2 FROM ConnectionEstablished
)
SELECT user1 AS id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM user_connections
GROUP BY user1
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>This solution creates a set of distinct user pairs who are connected, counting each connection once regardless of who initiated it.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using Common Table Expressions with subqueries</h4>
        <pre>
WITH connection_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS connections
    FROM (
        -- Combine both sender and receiver roles
        SELECT sender_id AS user_id FROM ConnectionEstablished
        UNION ALL
        SELECT receiver_id AS user_id FROM ConnectionEstablished
    ) AS all_users
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
    user_id AS id, 
    connections AS num
FROM connection_counts
WHERE connections = (SELECT MAX(connections) FROM connection_counts);
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>This solution uses a nested approach to find connections and then explicitly filters for the maximum value rather than using LIMIT.</p>

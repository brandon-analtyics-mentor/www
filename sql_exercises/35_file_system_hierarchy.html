<h2>File System Hierarchy Classification</h2>
    
<div class="section">
    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>Table: <code>FileSystem</code></p>
    <pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| file_id     | int  |
| parent_id   | int  |
+-------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><code>file_id</code> is the primary key column for this table.<br>
    Each row of this table contains information about the ID of a file and the ID of its parent directory in a file system.<br>
    The given structure is always a valid file system hierarchy.</p>
    
    <p>Each file in the system can be one of three types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"File"</strong>: if the node has a parent but is not a parent to any other node.</li>
        <li><strong>"Root"</strong>: if the node has no parent (parent_id is null).</li>
        <li><strong>"Directory"</strong>: If the node has both a parent and is a parent to at least one other node.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Write a solution to classify each node in the file system.</p>
    <p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Node 1 is the root directory because its parent is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.</li>
            <li>Node 2 is a directory because it has parent node 1 and child nodes 4 and 5.</li>
            <li>Node 3 is a directory because it has parent node 1 and child node 6.</li>
            <li>Nodes 4, 5, and 6 are files because they have parent nodes but they do not have child nodes.</li>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
    <pre>
-- create the filesystem table
create table filesystem (
    file_id int primary key,
    parent_id int
);

-- insert example data
insert into filesystem (file_id, parent_id) values
(1, null),
(2, 1),
(3, 1),
(4, 2),
(5, 2),
(6, 3);

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Identify nodes with no parent (parent_id is null) as "Root"</li>
        <li>Identify nodes that are parents to other nodes but also have parents themselves as "Directory"</li>
        <li>Identify nodes that have parents but are not parents to any other node as "File"</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use conditional logic with CASE statements to classify each node based on whether it has a parent and whether it is a parent to any other node.</p>

  <p>This approach requires checking if parent_id is null and also checking if the file_id appears as a parent_id for any other node in the table.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use subqueries or joins to identify which nodes are parents to other nodes, then use that information to classify each node.</p>

  <p>This approach involves creating a set of file_ids that are parents to other nodes, then using this information along with the parent_id value to determine the classification.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using CASE Expressions with Subqueries</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT
    f.file_id,
    CASE
        WHEN f.parent_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM filesystem 
            WHERE parent_id = f.file_id
        ) THEN 'Directory'
        ELSE 'File'
    END AS type
FROM
    filesystem f
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a CASE expression to classify each node based on the conditions specified in the problem:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If parent_id is NULL, the node is a "Root".</li>
        <li>If the file_id appears as a parent_id for any other node, it's a "Directory".</li>
        <li>Otherwise, it's a "File".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The EXISTS subquery efficiently checks if the current node is a parent to any other node.
    </p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using Left Join and CASE</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT
    f1.file_id,
    CASE
        WHEN f1.parent_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN f2.file_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Directory'
        ELSE 'File'
    END AS type
FROM
    filesystem f1
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT parent_id FROM filesystem WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL) AS f2
ON
    f1.file_id = f2.parent_id
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a LEFT JOIN to determine if a node is a parent to any other node. The subquery creates a distinct list of parent_ids (which are file_ids that are parents to other nodes).</p>

    <p>If the join finds a match, it means the current node is a parent to at least one other node. Combined with checking if parent_id is NULL, we can classify each node as "Root", "Directory", or "File".</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using Common Table Expression (CTE)</h4>
    <pre>
WITH parent_nodes AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT parent_id
    FROM filesystem
    WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
    f.file_id,
    CASE
        WHEN f.parent_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN p.parent_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Directory'
        ELSE 'File'
    END AS type
FROM
    filesystem f
LEFT JOIN
    parent_nodes p ON f.file_id = p.parent_id
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first create a set of all nodes that are parents to other nodes. Then, it joins this CTE with the main table to classify each node.</p>

    <p>The approach is similar to Solution 2 but uses a CTE for better readability and potentially better performance in some database systems, especially for more complex queries.</p>

    <p>The classification logic remains the same: check if parent_id is NULL for "Root", check if the node is in the parent_nodes set for "Directory", otherwise it's a "File".</p>

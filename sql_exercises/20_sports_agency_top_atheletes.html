            compensation amounts for that sport.

    <h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we need to find the athletes with the top three unique compensation amounts in each sport.

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Solution 1: Using DENSE_RANK() Window Function</h4>
        <pre>
select 
    s.sport_name as "sport"
  , a.player_name as "athlete"
  , a.compensation as "compensation"

from 
    (
      select 
        , a.player_id
        . a.player_name
        , a.compensation
        , a.sport_id
        , dense_rank() over (
              partition by a.sport_id 
              order by a.compensation desc
          ) as compensation_rank
      from 
          athlete a
    ) a
    
    join sport s 
       on a.sport_id = s.sport_id

            <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution uses the DENSE_RANK() window function to rank athletes within each sport by their compensation in descending order. The DENSE_RANK() function assigns the same rank to athletes with the same compensation, which is important for our problem since we're looking for top three unique compensation amounts. We then filter to include only those with a rank of 3 or less.

        <h4>Solution 2: Using a Correlated Subquery</h4>
        <pre>
select 
    s.sport_name as "sport",
  , a.player_name as "athlete"
  , a.compensation as "compensation"

from 
    athlete a
      
      join sport s
         on a.sport_id = s.sport_id

where 
    (
        select
            count(distinct a2.compensation)
        from
          athlete a2
        where
              1=1
          and a2.sport_id = a.sport_id
          and a2.compensation >= a.compensation
    ) <= 3

order by 
    s.sport_name

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution uses a correlated subquery that counts the number of distinct compensation amounts that are greater than or equal to each athlete's compensation within the same sport. If this count is less than or equal to 3, then the athlete has one of the top three unique compensation amounts in their sport.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Solution 3: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE)</h4>
        <pre>
with ranked_athletes as (
  select 
      a.player_id
    , a.player_name
    , a.compensation
    , a.sport_id
    , s.sport_name
    , dense_rank() over (
          partition by a.sport_id 
          order by a.compensation desc
      ) as compensation_rank
  from 
      athlete a
      
        join sport s
           on a.sport_id = s.sport_id
)

select 
    sport_name as "sport"
  , player_name as "athlete"
  , compensation as "compensation"

from 
    ranked_athletes r

    r.compensation_rank <= 3

order by 
    r.sport_name

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution is similar to Solution 1 but uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) for better readability. It first creates a temporary result set with the ranked athletes, then filters and orders the results. The CTE approach makes the SQL more modular and easier to understand.

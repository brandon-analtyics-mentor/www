        <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>

-- Create the Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (

    <h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we need to find all products that have never been reviewed. This means finding products in the Products table that don't have any corresponding entries in the Reviews table.

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Solution 1: Using LEFT JOIN</h4>
        <pre>
select 
  p.title as "unreviewedproducts"

from
  products p
    
    left join reviews r
       on p.product_id = r.product_id

where
  r.review_id is null
;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution uses a LEFT JOIN to include all products from the Products table and match them with reviews from the Reviews table. The WHERE clause filters to keep only the products where no matching review was found (indicated by r.review_id IS NULL).
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using NOT IN</h4>
        <pre>
select
  p.title as "unreviewedproducts"

from
  products p

where
  pproduct_id not in (
                      select
                        r.product_id
                      from
                        reviews r
                    )
;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution uses a subquery with NOT IN to find products whose IDs are not present in the Reviews table. It selects all product_ids from the Reviews table and then returns products that are not in that list. While this solution works, is it generally not a best practice to use "not in" when comparing one table to a potententially a long list in another table. A left join would have been preferred.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using NOT EXISTS</h4>
        <pre>
select 
  p.title as "unreviewedproducts"

from
  products p

where not exists (
                    select
                      1
                    from
                      reviews r
                    where
                      r.product_id = p.product_id
                  )
;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution uses NOT EXISTS with a correlated subquery. For each product in the Products table, it checks if there exists any review with a matching product_id. If no such review exists, the product is included in the results.

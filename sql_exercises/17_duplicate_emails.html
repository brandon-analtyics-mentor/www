        <h3>Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Table: <code>Contact</code></p>
        <pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contact_id  | int     |

        </pre>
        
        <p><code>contact_id</code> is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.<br>
        Each row of this table contains a phone number. The phone numbers will be in a standardized format.</p>
        
        <p>Write a solution to report all the duplicate phone numbers. Note that it's guaranteed that the phone field is not NULL.<br>
        Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.<br>
        The result format is in the following example.</p>

        <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
        <pre>
-- Create the Contact table
CREATE TABLE Contact (
    contact_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL

-- Insert example data
INSERT INTO Contact (contact_id, phone) VALUES
(101, '555-123-4567'),
(102, '555-987-6543'),
(103, '555-123-4567'),

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Solution 1: Using GROUP BY and HAVING</h4>
        <pre>
select 
  c.phone as "Phone"

from 
  contact c

group by
  c.phone

having
  count(c.phone) > 1
;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
            <p>This solution groups the records by phone number using GROUP BY and then uses the HAVING clause to filter only those groups that have more than one record. This is a straightforward and efficient approach for finding duplicate values in a database.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using a self-join</h4>
        <pre>
select 
    distinct c1.phone as "Phone"
from
  contact c1
    join contact c2
       on c1.phone = c2.phone
where
  c1.contact_id <> c2.contact_id
  ;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
            <p>This solution uses a self-join to compare each record with all other records in the same table. We join the table to itself on matching phone numbers, but exclude pairs where the contact_id is the same. The DISTINCT keyword ensures we only get unique phone numbers in our result.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using window functions</h4>
        <pre>
with phone_counts as (
  select 
      c.phone
    , count(1) over (partition by c.phone) as count
  
  from 
    contact c
)

select 
    distinct c.phone as "Phone"

from
  phone_counts c

where 
  c.count > 1
;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
            <p>This solution uses a window function to count occurrences of each phone number. The COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY phone) creates a count for each phone number group without actually grouping the results. We then filter for phone numbers with a count greater than 1 in the outer query.</p>

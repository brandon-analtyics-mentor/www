    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>Table: <code>Streams</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| song_id       | int     |

    <p>There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, so the table may have duplicate rows.<br>
    Each row of this table indicates that some listener streamed a song (composed by a musician) on a specific date.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Equal musician_id and listener_id indicate the same person.</p>
    
    <p>Write a solution to find all the musicians who listened to at least one of their own songs.</p>
    
    <p>Return the result table sorted by <code>id</code> in ascending order.</p>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Musician 6 streamed their own song (song_id: 408) on 2023-03-22 (appears twice in the table).</li>
            <li>Musician 8 streamed their own song (song_id: 214) on 2023-04-12.</li>
            <li>Musician 5 did not stream any of their own songs.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the output includes the ids of musicians 6 and 8, sorted in ascending order.</li>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
    <pre>
-- Create Streams table
CREATE TABLE Streams (
    song_id INT,
    musician_id INT,
    listener_id INT,
    stream_date DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Streams (song_id, musician_id, listener_id, stream_date) VALUES
(103, 5, 9, '2023-04-12'),
(103, 5, 7, '2023-04-15'),
(214, 8, 8, '2023-04-12'),
(214, 8, 7, '2023-04-13'),
(315, 8, 3, '2023-03-25'),
(408, 6, 6, '2023-03-22'),
(408, 6, 6, '2023-03-22');

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Find all musician_ids where the musician has listened to their own song</li>
        <li>This means finding records where musician_id equals listener_id</li>
        <li>Sort the results by id in ascending order</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a simple WHERE clause to filter records where the musician_id equals the listener_id. This directly identifies musicians who listened to their own songs.</p>

  <p>This approach is straightforward and efficient, utilizing the condition mentioned in the problem description about equal musician_id and listener_id indicating the same person.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use an INNER JOIN approach to find musicians who have streamed their own songs by joining the Streams table with itself.</p>

  <p>This approach joins records where the musician_id in one record matches the listener_id in another for the same song, ensuring we identify musicians who listened to songs they composed.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 3:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use an EXISTS subquery to check for the existence of records where a musician has listened to their own song.</p>

  <p>This approach uses a correlated subquery to find cases where the song_id matches and the musician_id from the outer query equals the listener_id in the inner query.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using WHERE clause</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT DISTINCT musician_id AS id
FROM Streams
WHERE musician_id = listener_id
ORDER BY id;
    </pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution simply filters the Streams table to find records where the musician_id equals the listener_id, which directly identifies musicians who listened to their own songs. We use DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate results and sort by id in ascending order as required.</p>

        <p>This is the most straightforward approach and likely the most efficient for this particular problem.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using INNER JOIN approach</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT DISTINCT s1.musician_id AS id
FROM Streams s1
INNER JOIN Streams s2 ON s1.musician_id = s2.listener_id AND s1.song_id = s2.song_id
WHERE s1.musician_id = s2.musician_id
ORDER BY id;
    </pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution uses a self-join on the Streams table to find pairs of records where a musician has streamed their own song. We join on the condition that the musician_id in one record matches the listener_id in another for the same song_id.</p>

        <p>The WHERE clause ensures that we're only looking at records where the musician_id is the same in both joined records, confirming that we're identifying the correct musicians.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using EXISTS subquery</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT DISTINCT s1.musician_id AS id
FROM Streams s1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Streams s2
    WHERE s2.song_id = s1.song_id
    AND s2.musician_id = s1.musician_id
    AND s2.listener_id = s1.musician_id
)
ORDER BY id;
    </pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution uses an EXISTS subquery to check if there's at least one record where a musician has listened to their own song. The subquery looks for records where the song_id matches, the musician_id matches, and the listener_id equals the musician_id from the outer query.</p>

        <p>This approach might be more readable for complex conditions and can be efficient since it only needs to find one matching record for the EXISTS condition to be satisfied.</p>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Count the number of collaborations between each musician-producer pair</li>
        <li>Filter to find pairs where the count is at least 3</li>
        <li>Return the musician_id and producer_id for these pairs</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use GROUP BY to count collaborations between each musician-producer pair, then use the HAVING clause to filter for pairs with at least 3 collaborations.</p>

  <p>This approach is straightforward and efficient, using aggregation to solve the problem in a single query.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a subquery or CTE to first count the number of collaborations for each pair, then select only those pairs where the count is at least 3.</p>

  <p>This approach separates the counting and filtering steps, which might be clearer for complex queries or when additional processing is needed.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using GROUP BY with HAVING</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT 
    musician_id,
    producer_id
FROM 
    MusicianProducer
GROUP BY 
    musician_id, producer_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) >= 3;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution groups the data by musician_id and producer_id, effectively creating groups for each unique musician-producer pair. The COUNT(*) function counts the number of rows in each group, which represents the number of collaborations for that pair.</p>

    <p>The HAVING clause filters the groups, keeping only those where the count is at least 3. This gives us the musician-producer pairs that have collaborated at least three times.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE)</h4>
    <pre>
WITH CollaborationCounts AS (
    SELECT
        musician_id,
        producer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS collab_count
    FROM
        MusicianProducer
    GROUP BY
        musician_id, producer_id
)

SELECT
    musician_id,
    producer_id
FROM
    CollaborationCounts
WHERE
    collab_count >= 3;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named CollaborationCounts to first calculate the number of collaborations for each musician-producer pair.</p>

    <p>In the CTE, we group by musician_id and producer_id and count the number of rows in each group using COUNT(*). Then, in the main query, we select only those pairs where the collaboration count is at least 3.</p>

    <p>This approach separates the counting logic from the filtering, making the query potentially more readable and maintainable, especially for more complex cases.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using a Subquery</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT
    mp.musician_id,
    mp.producer_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        musician_id,
        producer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS collab_count
    FROM 
        MusicianProducer
    GROUP BY 
        musician_id, producer_id
) mp
WHERE 
    mp.collab_count >= 3;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    Similar to Solution 2, this approach uses a subquery instead of a CTE to first count the number of collaborations for each musician-producer pair.</p>

    <p>The subquery groups by musician_id and producer_id, counting the rows in each group. The outer query then filters these results to include only pairs with at least 3 collaborations.</p>

    <p>This solution achieves the same result as the previous ones but uses a different SQL construct. The choice between a CTE and a subquery often comes down to personal preference or specific database optimization considerations.</p>

        <h3>Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Table: <code>UserAccount</code></p>

        <p><code>account_id</code> is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.<br>
        Each row of this table contains a username. The usernames will be all lowercase.</p>
        
        <p>Write a solution to <strong>delete</strong> all duplicate usernames, keeping only one unique username with the smallest <code>account_id</code>.</p>
    
        <p>For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a <code>DELETE</code> statement and not a <code>SELECT</code> one.</p>
        
        <p>After running your script, the answer shown is the <code>UserAccount</code> table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the <code>UserAccount</code> table. The final order of the <code>UserAccount</code> table <strong>does not matter</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

                <li>alex23 appears twice (account_id 101 and 305). We keep the row with the smallest account_id = 101.</li>
                <li>maria_smith appears twice (account_id 203 and 511). We keep the row with the smallest account_id = 203.</li>
                <li>taylor_dev appears only once, so it is kept.</li>

    <h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Identify all duplicate usernames in the UserAccount table</li>
            <li>For each set of duplicates, keep only the row with the smallest account_id</li>
            <li>Delete all other duplicate rows</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can use a subquery to identify the duplicate rows we want to delete. We'll find all account_ids that have the same username but not the minimum account_id for that username.</p>

      <p>This approach requires us to first identify all usernames that appear more than once, then find the minimum account_id for each of these usernames, and finally delete all rows where the account_id is not the minimum for that username.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to rank each username occurrence by account_id, then delete all rows where the rank is greater than 1.</p>

      <p>This approach uses window functions to assign a rank to each row within the partition of its username, ordered by account_id. Then we delete all rows where the rank is not 1, which means keeping only the row with the smallest account_id for each username.</p>

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Solution 1: Using Subquery to Find Duplicates</h4>
        <pre>
delete from useraccount
where 
  account_id in (
                  select 
                    ua.account_id
                  
                  from 
                    useraccount ua
                    
                      join (
                              select
                                  u.username
                                , min(u.account_id) as min_id
                              
                              from
                                useraccount u
                              
                              group by
                                u.username

                              having 
                                count(*) > 1
                            ) d
                        on ua.username = d.username
                  where
                    ua.account_id > d.min_id
                )
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution works by first finding all usernames that appear more than once using a GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT(*) > 1. For each of these duplicate usernames, we find the minimum account_id. Then we delete all rows where the account_id is not the minimum for that username.</p>

    <p>Notice that this query only targets duplicates, leaving unique username entries untouched. This makes the query efficient since it only processes the rows it needs to delete.</p>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using Window Functions for Ranking</h4>
        <pre>
delete from useraccount
where 
  account_id in (
                  select
                    r.account_id

                  from (
                          select
                              u.account_id 
                            , row_number() over (partition by u.username order by u.account_id) as rank
                          from
                            useraccount u
                        ) r

                  where
                    r.rank > 1
                )
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses the ROW_NUMBER() window function to assign a rank to each row within its username partition, ordered by account_id. The first occurrence of each username (with the smallest account_id) gets rank 1, and subsequent occurrences get higher ranks.</p>

    <p>We then delete all rows where the rank is greater than 1, which means we keep only the row with the smallest account_id for each username.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using a CTE with Self-Join</h4>
        <pre>
with duplicate_accounts as (
  select
    ua1.account_id
  
  from
    useraccount ua1
      
      join useraccount ua2
         on ua1.username = ua2.username
  where
    ua1.account_id > ua2.account_id
)

delete from useraccount
where 
  account_id in (
                  select
                    d.account_id 
                  from
                    duplicate_accounts d
                )
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a self-join to find all pairs of rows with the same username. For each pair, we identify the row with the larger account_id as the one to delete.</p>

    <p>The CTE (Common Table Expression) named DuplicateAccounts collects all account_ids that should be deleted. Then, we delete all rows where the account_id is in this list.</p>

    <p>This approach is straightforward and works well for moderate-sized datasets, though it might be less efficient for very large tables due to the self-join operation.</p>

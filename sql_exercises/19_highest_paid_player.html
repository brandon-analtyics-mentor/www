    <h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we re-state what we are asked to do, at a very granular level:
        <ul>
            <li>We need to find players who have the highest contract value in each team</li>
            <li>If multiple players have the same highest contract value in a team, we should include all of them</li>
            <li>We need to return the team name, player name, and contract value</li>
        </ul>
        Now that we are clear on what is requested, we can break the problem down into steps to solve it effectively.
    </p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can use a window function to rank players within each team based on their contract value. Then we can filter to only include the players with the highest rank (highest contract value) in each team.</p>

      <p>This approach allows us to identify the highest-paid players in a single pass through the data, and then join with the Team table to get the team names.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can use a subquery to find the maximum contract value for each team. Then join this result with the Player table to find all players who match these maximum values.</p>

      <p>This approach first identifies the maximum contract value per team, then finds all players whose contract values match these maximums.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 3:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can join the Player and Team tables first to get all the information we need. Then we can use a self-join to filter out players who don't have the highest contract in their team.</p>

      <p>This approach joins the tables first to establish the relationship between players and teams, then uses a self-join to compare each player's contract value with others in the same team.</p>

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Solution 1: Using Window Functions</h4>
        <pre>
with ranked_players as (
    select 
        p.player_id
      , p.player_name
      , p.contract_value
      , p.team_id
      , t.team_name
      , rank() over (partition by p.team_id order by p.contract_value desc) as contract_rank
    
    from 
        player p
        
          join team t
             on p.team_id = t.team_id
)

select 
    r.team_name as team
  , r.player_name as player
  , r.contract_value as contract

from 
    ranked_players r

where 
    r.contract_rank = 1

order by 
    r.team_name
  , r.player_name
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses the RANK() window function to assign a rank to each player within their team based on contract value (in descending order). Then we filter to only include players with rank = 1, which means they have the highest contract value in their team.</p>
    <p>The PARTITION BY clause ensures that ranking is done separately for each team. If multiple players have the same highest contract value in a team, they will all receive rank = 1, which is what we want.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using a Subquery</h4>
        <pre>
select 
    t.team_name as team
  , p.player_name as player
  , p.contract_value as contract

from 
    player p
    
      join team t
         on p.team_id = t.team_id

      -- Get max contract value
      join (
              select 
                  p.team_id 
                , max(p.contract_value) as max_contract
              
              from 
                player p
              
              group by 
                p.team_id
            ) m
         on p.team_id = m.team_id
        and p.contract_value = m.max_contract

order by 
    t.team_name
  , p.player_name
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a subquery to find the maximum contract value for each team. Then it joins the Player and Team tables with this subquery to find all players whose contract values match these maximums.</p>
    <p>The GROUP BY in the subquery ensures we get the maximum contract value for each team separately. The JOIN conditions ensure we only get players whose contract values equal the maximum for their team.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using NOT EXISTS</h4>
        <pre>
select 
    t.team_name as team
  , p.player_name as player
  , p.contract_value as contract

from 
    player p

      join team t
         on p.team_id = t.team_id

where 
    not exists (
                  select
                    1
                  from
                    player p2
                  where
                        1=1
                    and p2.team_id = p.team_id
                    and p2.contract_value > p.contract_value
                )
order by 
    t.team_name
  , p.player_name
;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a NOT EXISTS clause with a correlated subquery to check that there are no other players in the same team with a higher contract value.</p>
    <p>For each player, the subquery looks for other players in the same team with a higher contract value. If none are found (NOT EXISTS returns true), then this player must have the highest contract value in their team.</p>
    <p>This approach is particularly useful when we want to find records that have no "better" alternatives according to some criteria.</p>

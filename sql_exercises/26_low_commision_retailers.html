<div class="section">
    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>
        Given two tables: <code>Retailer</code> and <code>Commission</code>, write a SQL query to find all retailers with a commission less than 1500 or with no commission.
    </p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Retailer</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| retailId      | int  |
| retailName    | varchar |
| manager       | int  |
| revenue       | int  |
+---------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><code>retailId</code> is the primary key, unique identifier for each retailer.</p>
    
    <p>Table: <code>Commission</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| retailId      | int  |
| commission    | int  |
+---------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><code>retailId</code> is the primary key, foreign key to Retailer table.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Input:</strong><br>Retailer table:</p>
    <pre>
+----------+------------+---------+---------+
| retailId | retailName | manager | revenue |
+----------+------------+---------+---------+
| 5        | Sophia     | null    | 8000    |
| 2        | Miguel     | 5       | 3000    |
| 3        | Aisha      | 5       | 5000    |
| 7        | Lucas      | 5       | 7500    |
+----------+------------+---------+---------+
    </pre>
    
    <p>Commission table:</p>

+----------+------------+
| retailId | commission |
+----------+------------+
| 3        | 900        |
| 7        | 2500       |
+----------+------------+

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sophia has no commission record, so her commission is null.</li>
            <li>Miguel has no commission record, so his commission is null.</li>
            <li>Aisha has a commission of 900, which is less than 1500.</li>
            <li>Lucas has a commission of 2500, which is greater than 1500, so he is not included.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
    <pre>
-- Create Retailer table
CREATE TABLE Retailer (
    retailId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    retailName VARCHAR(100),
    manager INT,
    revenue INT
);

-- Create Commission table
CREATE TABLE Commission (
    retailId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    commission INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (retailId) REFERENCES Retailer(retailId)
);

-- Insert data into Retailer table
INSERT INTO Retailer (retailId, retailName, manager, revenue)
VALUES
    (5, 'Sophia', NULL, 8000),
    (2, 'Miguel', 5, 3000),
    (3, 'Aisha', 5, 5000),
    (7, 'Lucas', 5, 7500);

-- Insert data into Commission table
INSERT INTO Commission (retailId, commission)
VALUES
    (3, 900),
    (7, 2500);

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Find retailers with commission less than 1500</li>
        <li>Find retailers with no commission</li>
        <li>Combine these results</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a LEFT JOIN to include all retailers, even those without a commission entry. The WHERE clause filters for commissions less than 1500 or NULL.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a subquery with NOT EXISTS to filter out retailers with commissions greater than or equal to 1500.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 3:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use UNION to combine two separate queries: one for retailers with commissions less than 1500, and another for retailers with no commission records.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using LEFT JOIN</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT r.retailName, c.commission
FROM Retailer r
LEFT JOIN Commission c ON r.retailId = c.retailId
WHERE c.commission < 1500 OR c.commission IS NULL;
</pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution uses a LEFT JOIN to include all retailers, even those without a commission entry.
        The WHERE clause filters for commissions less than 1500 or NULL.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using a subquery with NOT EXISTS</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT r.retailName, 
       (SELECT c.commission FROM Commission c WHERE c.retailId = r.retailId) AS commission
FROM Retailer r
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Commission c 
    WHERE c.retailId = r.retailId AND c.commission >= 1500
);
</pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution uses a subquery to get the commission and another subquery with NOT EXISTS to 
        filter out retailers with commissions greater than or equal to 1500.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using UNION for better performance with large datasets</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT r.retailName, c.commission
FROM Retailer r
INNER JOIN Commission c ON r.retailId = c.retailId
WHERE c.commission < 1500

UNION

SELECT r.retailName, NULL AS commission
FROM Retailer r
WHERE r.retailId NOT IN (SELECT c.retailId FROM Commission c);
</pre>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
        <p>
        This solution uses UNION to combine two queries:
        1. Retailers with commissions less than 1500
        2. Retailers with no commission records</p>
        
        <p>This approach can be more efficient for large datasets because it avoids scanning the entire Commission table for each row in Retailer.</p>

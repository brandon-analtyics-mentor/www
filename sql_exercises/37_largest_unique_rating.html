<h2>Largest Unique Rating</h2>

    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>Table: <code>ProductRatings</code></p>
    <pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| rating        | int  |
+---------------+------+
    </pre>
    
    <p>This table may contain duplicate ratings (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).<br>
    Each row of this table contains an integer representing a product rating.</p>
    
    <p>A <strong>unique rating</strong> is a rating that appears exactly once in the <code>ProductRatings</code> table.</p>
    
    <p>Write an SQL query to find the largest <strong>unique rating</strong>. If there is no <strong>unique rating</strong>, report <code>null</code>.</p>
    
    <p>The query result format is shown in the following examples:</p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
    <strong>Input:</strong><br>ProductRatings table:</p>
    <pre>
+--------+
| rating |
+--------+
| 9      |
| 9      |
| 5      |
| 5      |
| 2      |
| 7      |
| 8      |
| 3      |
+--------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <pre>
+--------+
| rating |
+--------+
| 8      |
+--------+</pre>
    
    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The unique ratings are 2, 3, 7, and 8. Since 8 is the largest unique rating, we return it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
    <strong>Input:</strong><br>ProductRatings table:</p>
    <pre>
+--------+
| rating |
+--------+
| 9      |
| 9      |
| 6      |
| 6      |
| 4      |
| 4      |
| 4      |
+--------+
    </pre>
    
    <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <pre>
+--------+
| rating |
+--------+
| null   |
+--------+</pre>
    
    <div class="explanation">
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> There are no unique ratings in the input table so we return null.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Setup Code</h3>
    <pre>
-- create the productratings table
create table productratings (
    rating int
);

-- insert example 1 data
insert into productratings (rating) values
(9), (9), (5), (5), (2), (7), (8), (3);

-- For example 2, you would clear the table and insert:
-- insert into productratings (rating) values
-- (9), (9), (6), (6), (4), (4), (4);
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
<p>
    To solve this problem, we need to:
    <ul>
        <li>Find all ratings that appear exactly once in the ProductRatings table</li>
        <li>From these unique ratings, find the largest one</li>
        <li>If no unique ratings exist, return null</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a GROUP BY clause to count occurrences of each rating, then filter for ratings that appear exactly once. Finally, we can use MAX to find the largest unique rating.</p>

  <p>This approach requires us to first identify all unique ratings (those with a count of 1), and then find the maximum value among them.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
  
  <p>We can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first identify all unique ratings, then find the maximum value from that set.</p>

  <p>This approach separates the process into two steps: first identifying unique ratings, then finding the maximum among them.</p>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Solution 1: Using GROUP BY and HAVING</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT MAX(rating) as rating
FROM (
    SELECT rating
    FROM productratings
    GROUP BY rating
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) as unique_ratings;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution first uses a subquery to find all ratings that appear exactly once in the table (using GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*) = 1). Then it applies the MAX function to find the largest unique rating.</p>

    <p>If there are no unique ratings, MAX will return NULL, which satisfies our requirement for the case when no unique ratings exist.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 2: Using CTE (Common Table Expression)</h4>
    <pre>
WITH unique_ratings AS (
    SELECT rating
    FROM productratings
    GROUP BY rating
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)

SELECT MAX(rating) as rating
FROM unique_ratings;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a CTE named unique_ratings to first identify all ratings that appear exactly once. Then, it finds the maximum value among these unique ratings.</p>

    <p>The result is the same as Solution 1, but the CTE approach makes the query more readable and maintainable.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Solution 3: Using NOT IN with Subquery</h4>
    <pre>
SELECT MAX(r1.rating) as rating
FROM productratings r1
WHERE r1.rating NOT IN (
    SELECT r2.rating
    FROM productratings r2
    WHERE r2.rating = r1.rating
    GROUP BY r2.rating
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses a different approach. It first identifies all ratings that appear more than once using a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*) > 1. Then, it finds the maximum rating among those that do NOT appear in the list of non-unique ratings.</p>

    <p>This approach effectively finds ratings that are not duplicated, which are our unique ratings, and then returns the maximum among them.</p>

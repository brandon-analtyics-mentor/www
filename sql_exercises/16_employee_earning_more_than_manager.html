        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Solution 1: Using JOIN</h4>
        <pre>
select 
  d1.dev_name as "Developer"

from
  developer d1

    join developer d2
       on d1.lead_id = d2.dev_id

where
  d1.compensation > d2.compensation
;
</pre>

            <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution uses a self-join to connect developers with their team leads. By joining the Developer table with itself, we create pairs of developers and their respective leads. Then we simply filter for cases where the developer's compensation is greater than their lead's compensation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using self-join with explicit join syntax</h4>
        <pre>
select
  e.dev_name as "Developer"

from
  developer e -- employee

    inner join developer l --lead
      on e.lead_id = l.dev_id

where
  e.compensation > l.compensation
;
</pre>

            <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This solution also uses a self-join but with more explicit table aliases (employee and lead) to make the query more readable. The logic is the same as Solution 1, but the naming makes it clearer what relationship we're examining.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using a subquery</h4>
        <pre>
select
  d.dev_name as "Developer"

from
  developer d

where
  d.compensation > (
                      select
                        d.compensation 
                      from
                        developer d 
                      where
                        s.dev_id = d.lead_id
                    )
;
</pre>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
            <p>
            This approach uses a subquery instead of a join. For each developer, we find their lead's compensation using a subquery, and then compare it to the developer's own compensation. This solution can sometimes be more intuitive for people who find it easier to think about one table at a time.

    <h3>Restating and Approaching the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Group the data by month and region</li>
            <li>Calculate the total number of payments and their total value for each group</li>
            <li>Calculate the number of completed payments and their total value for each group</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can use the GROUP BY clause to group the data by month and region. To extract the month from the payment_date, we'll use the TO_CHAR() function.</p>

      <p>For each group, we'll count the total number of payments and sum their values. To count and sum only the completed payments, we can use conditional expressions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
      
      <p>We can use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first group all payments by month and region, and then join this with a second CTE that contains only completed payments.</p>

      <p>This approach separates the calculations for total payments and completed payments, which might make the query more readable.</p>

        <h4>Solution 1: Using Conditional Aggregation</h4>
        <pre>
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    region,
    COUNT(*) AS total_payments,
    SUM(value) AS total_value,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) AS completed_payments,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS completed_value
FROM
    payments
GROUP BY
    TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM'),
    region
ORDER BY
    month, region;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 1:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses conditional aggregation to calculate both total and completed payment statistics in a single query:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM') extracts the year and month from the payment date</li>
        <li>COUNT(*) counts all payments in each group</li>
        <li>SUM(value) calculates the total value of all payments</li>
        <li>COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) counts only completed payments</li>
        <li>SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN value ELSE 0 END) sums the values of only completed payments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The GROUP BY clause groups the results by month and region, and the ORDER BY clause sorts the results.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 2: Using Common Table Expressions</h4>
        <pre>
WITH all_payments AS (
    SELECT
        TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
        region,
        COUNT(*) AS total_payments,
        SUM(value) AS total_value
    FROM
        payments
    GROUP BY
        TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM'),
        region
),
completed_payments AS (
    SELECT
        TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
        region,
        COUNT(*) AS completed_payments,
        SUM(value) AS completed_value
    FROM
        payments
    WHERE
        status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY
        TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM'),
        region
)

SELECT
    a.month,
    a.region,
    a.total_payments,
    a.total_value,
    COALESCE(c.completed_payments, 0) AS completed_payments,
    COALESCE(c.completed_value, 0) AS completed_value
FROM
    all_payments a
LEFT JOIN
    completed_payments c
    ON a.month = c.month AND a.region = c.region
ORDER BY
    a.month, a.region;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 2:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the statistics separately:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first CTE, all_payments, calculates total payments statistics</li>
        <li>The second CTE, completed_payments, calculates statistics for completed payments only</li>
        <li>The main query joins these two CTEs to produce the final result</li>
        <li>COALESCE is used to handle cases where there might be no completed payments for a particular month and region</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This approach makes the query more modular and potentially easier to understand, especially for complex aggregations.</p>
</div>

        <h4>Solution 3: Using DATE_TRUNC for More Flexible Date Handling</h4>
        <pre>
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date), 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    region,
    COUNT(*) AS total_payments,
    SUM(value) AS total_value,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_payments,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS completed_value
FROM
    payments
GROUP BY
    DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date),
    region
ORDER BY
    month, region;
</pre>

<div class="explanation">
    <p><strong>Explanation 3:</strong></p>
    <p>
    This solution uses DATE_TRUNC to truncate the payment date to the month level, which can be more robust than using TO_CHAR for grouping:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) truncates the date to the first day of the month</li>
        <li>We still use TO_CHAR to format the output as 'YYYY-MM'</li>
        <li>Using DATE_TRUNC for grouping ensures that dates are properly grouped by month</li>
        <li>This approach can be more efficient for indexing and can handle different date formats more consistently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This solution combines the clarity of conditional aggregation with more robust date handling using PostgreSQL's specialized date functions.</p>
